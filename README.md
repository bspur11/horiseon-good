# Code Refactor Starter Code
##   This is the first challenge in the U of T Coding Boot Camp Course and the purpose is to refactor the given HTML and CSS code for structure and accessibility. To meet this purpose alt text was added to the images to provide descriptions of the images and an anchor link was fixed in the navigation links in the header.  The footer was commented out since the sample didn't have a footer, but can be uncommented and used at a future time if desired.
#
## Visual Studio Code was used to  edit the HTML, CSS and this Readme.md file.
#
## Git Bash and Git Hub were used to mave and host files repectively.

## A screenshot of the sample project is at this link:
